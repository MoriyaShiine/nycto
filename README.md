  <h3>Nycto adds vampires (and in a future update will add werewolves), and ways to become one or hunt them.</h3>
</div>

## Vampirism

To get started, kill a Vampire in forests or taigas on new moons and they will drop a Vampire Blood Bottle. Drink it to begin your unholy transformation.

You can sneak right click on valid mobs to feed, but if you'd like to obtain Blood Bottles for portable use, craft a Vampiric Dagger and attack villagers, piglins, or other humanoid mobs with it - once filled, it can be crafted with or right clicked with Glass Bottles to extract the blood.

Upgrading your vampiric powers further will require the use of a Vampire Altar (any candles or planks work).

You may choose up to 6 vampire powers at a time out of 13 total:
```
- Bat Form: Transforms you into a Bat, granting flight but reducing maximum health and damage dealt. Costs blood to maintain.
- Bat Swarm: Summons a swarm of bats that attacks and drinks the blood of anything that you attack or attacks you. Standing in the swarm feeds you the drained blood.
- Batstep: Instantly teleports you to where you're looking within a short distance, damaging and briefly stunning everything in your path.
- Blood Barrier: Creates 3 rings of blood that surround you for some time. The rings protect you from harm, but will break when hit with heavy damage.
- Blood Flechettes: Launches a burst of shards that halt healing on any mob they hit. Attacking a mob affected by this heals you and drains their blood.
- Bloodrush: Launches you forward wherever you are looking for some time. Extinguishes you if you're on fire.
- Carnage: Enter a berserk state, dealing increased damage to attacked mobs and causing them to rapidly hemorrhage blood.
- Dark Form: Transforms you into a hideous beast, granting increased damage and armor, and allows you to jump in the air. Cannot wear armor or use tools, but can break most blocks by hand. Increases in strength the more weaknesses you have. Costs blood to maintain.
- Haemogenesis: Rapidly regenerates health, removes heal block, and extinguishes you if you're on fire.
- Hypnotize: Forces all nearby mobs to follow and defend you for some time, or briefly stuns them if they're a player. Hypnotized mobs can have their blood sucked without damaging them. Success is dependent on their current health.
- Keen Senses: Muffles sounds and highlights mobs with a color depending on their blood type, including those that are invisible or behind walls. Grants a speed boost while active. Costs blood to maintain.
- Mist Form: Transforms you into a cloud of mist, becoming invisible, negating fall damage, and phasing through most nonsolid blocks. Attacking a mob always results in a critical hit and reveals you. The first hit of damage you take is negated and reveals you. Costs blood to maintain.
- Vampiric Thrall: Permanently enthralls a humanoid mob or tamed horse or wolf to become your minion. Thralls retain their abilities from before their undeath. Success is dependent on their current health. Can be told to either follow, stay, or wander by sneak interacting. Can be fed Blood Bottles by sneak interacting.
```

Every other power you choose must also come with a weakness:
```
- Hydrophobia: Hinders movement in water and rain.
- Photophobia: You burn much faster in the sun.
- Pyrophobia: Fire and lava deal more damage.
- Rich Tastes: You can only drink blood from humanoid mobs. Blood Bottles aren't as filling.
- Thin Blood: Blood no longer saves you from death.
- Vile Presence: Neutral mobs become aggressive, animals flee from you and cannot be bred or tamed, and villager trades are more expensive. Hypnotized mobs are unaffected.
```

Vampires can also make Vampire armor with the Blood Bottles they collect to enhance their vampiric abilities, and craft Coffins to sleep in during the day to skip to night.

## Hunting

If you'd like to hunt vampires instead, find Wild Garlic in forests and swamps.

Garlic can be used to make a wide variety of tools, such as the Garlic Wreath, Garlic-Coated Halberd, and Vampire Hunter armor! There are several other tools you can use to hunt them, such as Wooden Stakes, Garlic Brews, and Firebombs.
